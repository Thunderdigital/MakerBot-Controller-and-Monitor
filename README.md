I wanted to replace the factory makerbot desktop and makerbot print control programs.
The script is constantly evolving. Use only at your own risk.

This command-line version is currently waiting for a
print.makerbot
file to be uploaded, so save it with that name from Cura next to the script.

Non-factory calibration (menu points A,B,C,D) only works properly with a modified start.json script. I don't recommend using it for now.
